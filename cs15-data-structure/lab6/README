Program Purpose: For this task, we have to complete the implementation of 
the function solve(). Specifically, youâ€™ll implement either bool solve(in 
 row, int col) or bool solve(Position p) in the file maze.cpp.

Acknowledgements: 
TA helped to explain during lab. Prelab file offered some helper functions. 

Files: 
maze.cpp: TO_BE_MODIFIED : implement solve function and count the steps
(unfinished, but will work on it) 


Data Structures:

provided with the file.


Testing:
