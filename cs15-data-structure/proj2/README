This homework assignment contains some files that can be helpful towards 
implementing project 2


FSTree.h		: interface of FSTree class  (used to explore file directories)
FSTree.o		: compiled version of FSTree.cpp
DirNode.h 		: interface of DirNode class (nodes used in FSTree)
DirNode.o 		: compiled version of DirNode.cpp
hashExample.cpp : an example on how to use the hash function (and compression) 
                    with STL library
the_gerp		: compiled solution of this assignment (good for comparing 
                    purposes)
README 			: this file


PHASE 1:
FSTreeTraversal.cpp : traverses the file system from that starting point and 
                        lists all subdirectories and files within it
StringProcessing.cpp : read a string from cin, strips all leading and trailing 
                        non-alphanumeric characters from it, and print it the 
                        result

Design already checked off


PHASE 2:
TO BE CONTINUED
