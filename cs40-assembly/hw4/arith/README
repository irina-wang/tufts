     ---------------------  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  -----------------------
            
            We went to Wednesday Megan's OH and asked about naming
            functions, the balance between modularity and clarity, 
            as well as shifting and big and small Endian. We also 
            searched in google about 啊啊啊 




     -------------------------  COMPLETION  --------------------------

            We complete all functionalities asked in spec and go 
            through different testings. 


     -------------------------  ARCHITECTURE  -------------------------
           For this assignment, we created 啊啊啊 different modules, namely

            1) dct : does discrete cosine transform
                - obtain cosine coefficients (a, b,  c, d)
                - compute Y​1​, Y​2,​ Y​3​ and Y​4​ from a, b, c, d.

            2) blockpack : does packing and unpacking functionality
                - packing 2*2 block which converts the component video 
                   into binary image 
                - unpacking 2*2 block which converts the binary image 
                   into the component video

            3) imagerdr : reads and writes the binary image
                - read the image
                - write the image

            4) 


            compress40 is a module that group all the compressor or 
            decompressor functionalities together. So that the main 
            function in 40image can directly call either compress40 
            to perform all operations in the compressor, or call
            decompressor40 to perform all operations in the 
            decompressor.

            啊啊啊要不要说一下我们照着Hanson的做？
            

     ------------------------  Time of completion  ------------------------

                We used approximately 啊啊啊 hours to complete the 
            program, including 啊啊啊 hours of design time, 啊啊啊 
            hours of coding time, 啊啊啊 hours of testing time and
            啊啊啊 hours of documentation time.
