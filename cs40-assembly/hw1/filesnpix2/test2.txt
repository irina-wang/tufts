It was St. Augustine who best explained the relationship of the Old and New
 Testaments: 
"The new lies hidden in the old, the old is made manifest in the new."

The New Testament recorded the oral tradition of the Life and Teachings of 
Jesus Christ, his Passion, Death on the Cross, Resurrection and Ascension, 
and the formation of the early Christian community, the Church. 

Jesus of Nazareth and his Apostles spoke Aramaic, the common language at the
 time in the Levant. Syriac, a dialect of Aramaic, became the biblical and l
iturgical language of early Christian Churches in the East. Jesus the Messia
h addressed God in prayer, using the Aramaic word Abba, the affectionate ter
m for "Father" (Mark 14:36). Jesus raised the child by calling out Talitha c
umi, which means "little girl, arise" in Mark 5:41. He cured the man who was
 deaf and dumb by speaking Ephphatha, meaning "be opened" in Mark 7:34. Jesu
s refers to hell as Gehenna in Mark 9:42-50. Jesus used Aramaic words twice 
in referring to Peter: he used the prefix Bar-, "the son of," (not the Hebre
w Ben) when he called Peter Bar-Jonah, the son of Jonah (Matthew 16:17); and
 he called Peter Cephas, the Aramaic word for rock in John 1:42. Jesus cried

 out from the cross Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani, that is, "My God, my God, 
why have you forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46, Mark 15:34). 

The canon of the New Testament is exactly the same for all of Christianity! 
There are 27 Books in our Greek New Testament: the Gospels of Matthew, Mark,
 Luke, and John, the Acts of the Apostles, the fourteen Letters of the Pauli

ne corpus, the seven catholic or universal Letters, and the Book of Revelati
on. 

No original manuscript by the author of a biblical book has ever been discov
ered! The oldest manuscripts available to us are the Curetonian and Sinaitic
us texts of the Old Syriac Gospels, the Greek Codex Sinaiticus from St. Cath
erine's Monastery on Mt. Sinai, Egypt, and the Codex Vaticanus in Greek from
 the fourth century AD. 

The New Testament writers accorded to the Old Testament the value of Divine 
Revelation. They proclaimed this revelation found its fulfillment in the lif
e and teaching, and above all in the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus,
 source of forgiveness and of everlasting life. They frequently drew upon th
e Old Testament writings, primarily to confirm Jesus Christ as the Messiah, 

or to serve as a source for moral instruction, or for the interpretation of 
events. Typology in Biblical studies finds an Old Testament passage serving 
as a prefigurement or symbol for an event in the New Testament. Referring to
 Christ, Paul called Adam "a type of the one who is to come" (Romans 5:14). 
Peter saw the flood during the times of Noah as a figure of baptism (I Peter
 3:20-21). In a direct quotation, the Gospel writer acknowledged the source 
and directly quoted the Old Testament, as Matthew 1:22, after Jesus is born 
of the virgin Mary, quoted Isaiah 7:14 that prophesized the Messiah will be 
born of a virgin. An example of moral instruction would be Mark 10:2ff, when
 Jesus quoted Genesis 1:27 and 2:24 in his instruction on marriage. An allus
ion occurs when an obvious Old Testament source is woven in the text without

 acknowledging the source, such as Paul who refers to Genesis 3:15 in Romans

 16:20, and John who refers to that "ancient serpent" of Genesis 3 in Revela
tion 12:12. And finally the source may be unknown, as Matthew 2:23, when he 
cites the prophecy, "He shall be called a Nazarene." New Testament writings 
were considered Scripture in the early Christian Church (I Timothy 5:18, 
II Peter 3:16). 

The Tradition of the Church Fathers was important to the Church, for they 
had an important role in the formation of the canon of the New Testament - 
to choose those inspired books that best reflected the life and teachings 
of Christ, as well as the interpretation of Scripture. Irenaeus of Lyons 
circa 180 AD was among the first to propose a canon for the New Testament. 
Three Fathers of the Church - Athanasius of Alexandria in his Letter of 367
, Jerome at Bethlehem in 384, and Augustine at the Council of Hippo in 393 
- agreed 27 Books were the inspired Word of God. The Canon of the New Testament
 was confirmed at the Third Council of Carthage in 397 AD. 

The Four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John proclaim the "Good News" 
of the coming of Jesus Christ. Matthew, Mark, and Luke, called the Synoptic 
Gospels as they parallel each other, record Jesus teaching in Parables. Each 
of the Synoptics is noteworthy on their own, such as the Gospel of Matthew, 
which contains the Sermon on the Mount with the Beatitudes, the Lord's Prayer 
and the Golden Rule. Matthew and Luke are noted for their Infancy Narratives, 
describing the Nativity of Our Lord. The Synoptic Gospels also record the Last 
Supper of Christ and his direction to "Do this in remembrance of me" 
(Luke 22:19), the foundation for the Liturgy of the Eucharist, the Memorial 
of the Last Supper. The Gospel of John is an unique spiritual and theological 
work beginning with the Prologue - a mystical reflection on the Word, the 
Divinity and Incarnation of Jesus Christ. The Gospels present the Miracles 
and the Paschal Mystery of Christ Jesus - his Passion, Death on the Cross, 
Resurrection, and Glorious Ascension into Heaven. There are three stages in 
the development of the Gospel narrative: the teachings of Jesus himself; the 
oral tradition of the Apostles, who handed down the teachings of Jesus to the 
early Christian community, the Church; and finally, the inspired written Word 
of Scripture. The Bible was written within the Church. Considering the impact
 of his life and teaching, it is remarkable the Ministry of Jesus lasted 
 such a short time! 

The Acts of the Apostles is the second Book written by Luke and describes 
the dramatic emergence of Christianity following the Pentecost, the Descent 
of the Holy Spirit. Acts records the growth of the early Christian community,
 the Church, from Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria, Syria to Asia Minor, Europe 
 to Rome, focusing primarily on the activities of Peter, and Paul following 
 his Conversion. 

The Pauline corpus begins in the New Testament with the Letter to the 
Romans, which emphasizes God's righteousness that saves all who believe 
in Jesus Christ. The letter begins and ends with the ideal Christian response 
to our merciful Savior, "the obedience of faith" (Romans 1:5, 16:26). First 
Corinthians gives us an insight into the early Christian community, includes
 the beautiful passage on love, and speaks of the Resurrection of Christ and
  of the dead as well as the Resurrection Event. Second Corinthians is 
  personal in nature and reveals much about Paul's character. We are reminded
   that God's grace is sufficient for us. The Apostle to the Gentiles 
   emphasizes the way to salvation is through Christ and the Cross in Galatians.
    The Epistle of St. Paul to the Ephesians is the Pauline letter on the 
    Church. The Philippians were Paul's first Christian community in Europe, 
    and the letter shows his great love for the Gospel and his converts. 
    Colossians calls Jesus the head of his body the Church. Perhaps the 
    first writing to become part of the New Testament was First Thessalonians,
     which speaks of the Parousia, the second coming of the Lord. Second T
     hessalonians relates the events before the Parousia and emphasizes the 
     importance of the work ethic. First Timothy, Second Timothy, and Titus 
     are the Pastoral Epistles. He breathes love and equality into the ancient
      and once accepted institution of slavery in the Letter to Philemon. 
      The Letter to the Hebrews is an outstanding treatise on the priesthood
       of Jesus, who redeemed mankind by his one Sacrifice, which established
        God's New Covenant. Of the 14 letters of the Pauline Corpus, all but
         the Letter to the Hebrews begin with the name of Paul. St. Jerome
          added Hebrews to the Pauline Corpus when he translated the Greek 
          New Testament into Latin in the fourth century AD. 

The seven catholic or universal Letters of James (1), Peter (2), John (3), 
and Jude (1) are so called because they are addressed to all the Churches, 
unlike the letters of Paul, which are addressed to a particular community 
(example: Romans). They were open letters that concerned themselves with 
different themes pertinent to Christians. The Letter of James emphasizes the 
necessity of faith and works and speaks of the power of the tongue. First Peter 
shows us the mission of the early Church in the midst of a hostile society, 
and provides direction for Christian behavior in the world. Second Peter 
notes that God bestows on us life and godliness, that living a virtuous 
life will ensure our calling and election to eternal life with Christ. 
First John expresses that God is love, his forgiveness in the face of sin,
 and asserts the humanity and Divinity of Jesus Christ. Second John warns 
 against heresy in the early Church, while Third John is a testimony to 
 the fidelity of early Christian communities. The Book of Jude gives 
 encouragement in fidelity to the Christian faith and notes the moral 
 implications of the Gospel message. The mysterious Book of Jude also 
 describes a phenomenon noted in some anesthetic patients with near-death 
 experiences: "They are like wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shameless
  deeds, wandering stars for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved 
  forever." 

The Book of Revelation is the final Book of the New Testament and is 
apocalyptic in nature. The Book of Revelation is at once frightening, 
as it speaks of the rise of the evil one, the Great Tribulation, and 
the end of the age; dramatic as it describes the final battle of good 
and evil; and, above all, optimistic, as it points to the triumph of 
Jesus Christ over evil and the dawn of a New Creation. Written by John, i
t has fascinated readers for centuries as it prophesizes about the End Times, 
a time which may be drawing near.

 he called Peter Cephas, the Aramaic word for rock in John 1:42. Jesus cried

 out from the cross Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani, that is, "My God, my God, 
why have you forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46, Mark 15:34). 

The canon of the New Testament is exactly the same for all of Christianity! 
There are 27 Books in our Greek New Testament: the Gospels of Matthew, Mark,
 Luke, and John, the Acts of the Apostles, the fourteen Letters of the Pauli

ne corpus, the seven catholic or universal Letters, and the Book of Revelati
on. 

No original manuscript by the author of a biblical book has ever been discov
ered! The oldest manuscripts available to us are the Curetonian and Sinaitic
us texts of the Old Syriac Gospels, the Greek Codex Sinaiticus from St. Cath
erine's Monastery on Mt. Sinai, Egypt, and the Codex Vaticanus in Greek from
 the fourth century AD. 

The New Testament writers accorded to the Old Testament the value of Divine 
Revelation. They proclaimed this revelation found its fulfillment in the lif
e and teaching, and above all in the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus,
 source of forgiveness and of everlasting life. They frequently drew upon th
e Old Testament writings, primarily to confirm Jesus Christ as the Messiah, 

or to serve as a source for moral instruction, or for the interpretation of 
events. Typology in Biblical studies finds an Old Testament passage serving 
as a prefigurement or symbol for an event in the New Testament. Referring to
 Christ, Paul called Adam "a type of the one who is to come" (Romans 5:14). 
Peter saw the flood during the times of Noah as a figure of baptism (I Peter
 3:20-21). In a direct quotation, the Gospel writer acknowledged the source 
and directly quoted the Old Testament, as Matthew 1:22, after Jesus is born 
of the virgin Mary, quoted Isaiah 7:14 that prophesized the Messiah will be 
born of a virgin. An example of moral instruction would be Mark 10:2ff, when
 Jesus quoted Genesis 1:27 and 2:24 in his instruction on marriage. An allus
ion occurs when an obvious Old Testament source is woven in the text without

 acknowledging the source, such as Paul who refers to Genesis 3:15 in Romans

 16:20, and John who refers to that "ancient serpent" of Genesis 3 in Revela
tion 12:12. And finally the source may be unknown, as Matthew 2:23, when he 
cites the prophecy, "He shall be called a Nazarene." New Testament writings 
were considered Scripture in the early Christian Church (I Timothy 5:18, 
II Peter 3:16). 

The Tradition of the Church Fathers was important to the Church, for they 
had an important role in the formation of the canon of the New Testament - 
to choose those inspired books that best reflected the life and teachings 
of Christ, as well as the interpretation of Scripture. Irenaeus of Lyons 
circa 180 AD was among the first to propose a canon for the New Testament. 
Three Fathers of the Church - Athanasius of Alexandria in his Letter of 367
, Jerome at Bethlehem in 384, and Augustine at the Council of Hippo in 393 
- agreed 27 Books were the inspired Word of God. The Canon of the New Testament
 was confirmed at the Third Council of Carthage in 397 AD. 

The Four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John proclaim the "Good News" 
of the coming of Jesus Christ. Matthew, Mark, and Luke, called the Synoptic 
Gospels as they parallel each other, record Jesus teaching in Parables. Each 
of the Synoptics is noteworthy on their own, such as the Gospel of Matthew, 
which contains the Sermon on the Mount with the Beatitudes, the Lord's Prayer 
and the Golden Rule. Matthew and Luke are noted for their Infancy Narratives, 
describing the Nativity of Our Lord. The Synoptic Gospels also record the Last 
Supper of Christ and his direction to "Do this in remembrance of me" 
(Luke 22:19), the foundation for the Liturgy of the Eucharist, the Memorial 
of the Last Supper. The Gospel of John is an unique spiritual and theological 
work beginning with the Prologue - a mystical reflection on the Word, the 
Divinity and Incarnation of Jesus Christ. The Gospels present the Miracles 
and the Paschal Mystery of Christ Jesus - his Passion, Death on the Cross, 
Resurrection, and Glorious Ascension into Heaven. There are three stages in 
the development of the Gospel narrative: the teachings of Jesus himself; the 
oral tradition of the Apostles, who handed down the teachings of Jesus to the 
early Christian community, the Church; and finally, the inspired written Word 
of Scripture. The Bible was written within the Church. Considering the impact
 of his life and teaching, it is remarkable the Ministry of Jesus lasted 
 such a short time! 

The Acts of the Apostles is the second Book written by Luke and describes 
the dramatic emergence of Christianity following the Pentecost, the Descent 
of the Holy Spirit. Acts records the growth of the early Christian community,
 the Church, from Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria, Syria to Asia Minor, Europe 
 to Rome, focusing primarily on the activities of Peter, and Paul following 
 his Conversion. 

The Pauline corpus begins in the New Testament with the Letter to the 
Romans, which emphasizes God's righteousness that saves all who believe 
in Jesus Christ. The letter begins and ends with the ideal Christian response 
to our merciful Savior, "the obedience of faith" (Romans 1:5, 16:26). First 
Corinthians gives us an insight into the early Christian community, includes
 the beautiful passage on love, and speaks of the Resurrection of Christ and
  of the dead as well as the Resurrection Event. Second Corinthians is 
  personal in nature and reveals much about Paul's character. We are reminded
   that God's grace is sufficient for us. The Apostle to the Gentiles 
   emphasizes the way to salvation is through Christ and the Cross in Galatians.
    The Epistle of St. Paul to the Ephesians is the Pauline letter on the 
    Church. The Philippians were Paul's first Christian community in Europe, 
    and the letter shows his great love for the Gospel and his converts. 
    Colossians calls Jesus the head of his body the Church. Perhaps the 
    first writing to become part of the New Testament was First Thessalonians,
     which speaks of the Parousia, the second coming of the Lord. Second T
     hessalonians relates the events before the Parousia and emphasizes the 
     importance of the work ethic. First Timothy, Second Timothy, and Titus 
     are the Pastoral Epistles. He breathes love and equality into the ancient
      and once accepted institution of slavery in the Letter to Philemon. 
      The Letter to the Hebrews is an outstanding treatise on the priesthood
       of Jesus, who redeemed mankind by his one Sacrifice, which established
        God's New Covenant. Of the 14 letters of the Pauline Corpus, all but
         the Letter to the Hebrews begin with the name of Paul. St. Jerome
          added Hebrews to the Pauline Corpus when he translated the Greek 
          New Testament into Latin in the fourth century AD. 

The seven catholic or universal Letters of James (1), Peter (2), John (3), 
and Jude (1) are so called because they are addressed to all the Churches, 
unlike the letters of Paul, which are addressed to a particular community 
(example: Romans). They were open letters that concerned themselves with 
different themes pertinent to Christians. The Letter of James emphasizes the 
necessity of faith and works and speaks of the power of the tongue. First Peter 
shows us the mission of the early Church in the midst of a hostile society, 
and provides direction for Christian behavior in the world. Second Peter 
notes that God bestows on us life and godliness, that living a virtuous 
life will ensure our calling and election to eternal life with Christ. 
First John expresses that God is love, his forgiveness in the face of sin,
 and asserts the humanity and Divinity of Jesus Christ. Second John warns 
 against heresy in the early Church, while Third John is a testimony to 
 the fidelity of early Christian communities. The Book of Jude gives 
 encouragement in fidelity to the Christian faith and notes the moral 
 implications of the Gospel message. The mysterious Book of Jude also 
 describes a phenomenon noted in some anesthetic patients with near-death 
 experiences: "They are like wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shameless
  deeds, wandering stars for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved 
  forever." 

The Book of Revelation is the final Book of the New Testament and is 
apocalyptic in nature. The Book of Revelation is at once frightening, 
as it speaks of the rise of the evil one, the Great Tribulation, and 
the end of the age; dramatic as it describes the final battle of good 
and evil; and, above all, optimistic, as it points to the triumph of 
Jesus Christ over evil and the dawn of a New Creation. Written by John, i
t has fascinated readers for centuries as it prophesizes about the End Times, 
a time which may be drawing near.

It was St. Augustine who best explained the relationship of the Old and New
 Testaments: 
"The new lies hidden in the old, the old is made manifest in the new."

The New Testament recorded the oral tradition of the Life and Teachings of 
Jesus Christ, his Passion, Death on the Cross, Resurrection and Ascension, 
and the formation of the early Christian community, the Church. 

Jesus of Nazareth and his Apostles spoke Aramaic, the common language at the
 time in the Levant. Syriac, a dialect of Aramaic, became the biblical and l
iturgical language of early Christian Churches in the East. Jesus the Messia
h addressed God in prayer, using the Aramaic word Abba, the affectionate ter
m for "Father" (Mark 14:36). Jesus raised the child by calling out Talitha c
umi, which means "little girl, arise" in Mark 5:41. He cured the man who was
 deaf and dumb by speaking Ephphatha, meaning "be opened" in Mark 7:34. Jesu
s refers to hell as Gehenna in Mark 9:42-50. Jesus used Aramaic words twice 
in referring to Peter: he used the prefix Bar-, "the son of," (not the Hebre
w Ben) when he called Peter Bar-Jonah, the son of Jonah (Matthew 16:17); and
 he called Peter Cephas, the Aramaic word for rock in John 1:42. Jesus cried

 out from the cross Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani, that is, "My God, my God, 
why have you forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46, Mark 15:34).

e and teaching, and above all in the death and resurrection of Christ Jesus,
 source of forgiveness and of everlasting life. They frequently drew upon th
e Old Testament writings, primarily to confirm Jesus Christ as the Messiah, 

or to serve as a source for moral instruction, or for the interpretation of 
events. Typology in Biblical studies finds an Old Testament passage serving 
as a prefigurement or symbol for an event in the New Testament. Referring to
 Christ, Paul called Adam "a type of the one who is to come" (Romans 5:14). 
Peter saw the flood during the times of Noah as a figure of baptism (I Peter
 3:20-21). In a direct quotation, the Gospel writer acknowledged the source 
and directly quoted the Old Testament, as Matthew 1:22, after Jesus is born 
of the virgin Mary, quoted Isaiah 7:14 that prophesized the Messiah will be 
born of a virgin. An example of moral instruction would be Mark 10:2ff, when
 Jesus quoted Genesis 1:27 and 2:24 in his instruction on marriage. An allus
ion occurs when an obvious Old Testament source is woven in the text without

 acknowledging the source, such as Paul who refers to Genesis 3:15 in Romans

 16:20, and John who refers to that "ancient serpent" of Genesis 3 in Revela
tion 12:12. And finally the source may be unknown, as Matthew 2:23, when he 
cites the prophecy, "He shall be called a Nazarene." New Testament writings 
were considered Scripture in the early Christian Church (I Timothy 5:18, 
II Peter 3:16). 

The Tradition of the Church Fathers was important to the Church, for they 
had an important role in the formation of the canon of the New Testament - 
to choose those inspired books that best reflected the life and teachings 
of Christ, as well as the interpretation of Scripture. Irenaeus of Lyons 
circa 180 AD was among the first to propose a canon for the New Testament. 
Three Fathers of the Church - Athanasius of Alexandria in his Letter of 367
, Jerome at Bethlehem in 384, and Augustine at the Council of Hippo in 393 
- agreed 27 Books were the inspired Word of God. The Canon of the New Testament
 was confirmed at the Third Council of Carthage in 397 AD. 

The Four Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John proclaim the "Good News" 
of the coming of Jesus Christ. Matthew, Mark, and Luke, called the Synoptic 
Gospels as they parallel each other, record Jesus teaching in Parables. Each 
of the Synoptics is noteworthy on their own, such as the Gospel of Matthew, 
which contains the Sermon on the Mount with the Beatitudes, the Lord's Prayer 
and the Golden Rule. Matthew and Luke are noted for their Infancy Narratives, 
describing the Nativity of Our Lord. The Synoptic Gospels also record the Last 
Supper of Christ and his direction to "Do this in remembrance of me" 
(Luke 22:19), the foundation for the Liturgy of the Eucharist, the Memorial 
of the Last Supper. The Gospel of John is an unique spiritual and theological 
work beginning with the Prologue - a mystical reflection on the Word, the 
Divinity and Incarnation of Jesus Christ. The Gospels present the Miracles 
and the Paschal Mystery of Christ Jesus - his Passion, Death on the Cross, 
Resurrection, and Glorious Ascension into Heaven. There are three stages in 
the development of the Gospel narrative: the teachings of Jesus himself; the 
oral tradition of the Apostles, who handed down the teachings of Jesus to the 
early Christian community, the Church; and finally, the inspired written Word 
of Scripture. The Bible was written within the Church. Considering the impact
 of his life and teaching, it is remarkable the Ministry of Jesus lasted 
 such a short time! 

The Acts of the Apostles is the second Book written by Luke and describes 
the dramatic emergence of Christianity following the Pentecost, the Descent 
of the Holy Spirit. Acts records the growth of the early Christian community,
 the Church, from Jerusalem, Judea and Samaria, Syria to Asia Minor, Europe 
 to Rome, focusing primarily on the activities of Peter, and Paul following 
 his Conversion. 

The Pauline corpus begins in the New Testament with the Letter to the 
Romans, which emphasizes God's righteousness that saves all who believe 
in Jesus Christ. The letter begins and ends with the ideal Christian response 
to our merciful Savior, "the obedience of faith" (Romans 1:5, 16:26). First 
Corinthians gives us an insight into the early Christian community, includes
 the beautiful passage on love, and speaks of the Resurrection of Christ and
  of the dead as well as the Resurrection Event. Second Corinthians is 
  personal in nature and reveals much about Paul's character. We are reminded
   that God's grace is sufficient for us. The Apostle to the Gentiles 
   emphasizes the way to salvation is through Christ and the Cross in Galatians.
    The Epistle of St. Paul to the Ephesians is the Pauline letter on the 
    Church. The Philippians were Paul's first Christian community in Europe, 
    and the letter shows his great love for the Gospel and his converts. 
    Colossians calls Jesus the head of his body the Church. Perhaps the 
    first writing to become part of the New Testament was First Thessalonians,
     which speaks of the Parousia, the second coming of the Lord. Second T
     hessalonians relates the events before the Parousia and emphasizes the 
     importance of the work ethic. First Timothy, Second Timothy, and Titus 
     are the Pastoral Epistles. He breathes love and equality into the ancient
      and once accepted institution of slavery in the Letter to Philemon. 
      The Letter to the Hebrews is an outstanding treatise on the priesthood
       of Jesus, who redeemed mankind by his one Sacrifice, which established
        God's New Covenant. Of the 14 letters of the Pauline Corpus, all but
         the Letter to the Hebrews begin with the name of Paul. St. Jerome
          added Hebrews to the Pauline Corpus when he translated the Greek 
          New Testament into Latin in the fourth century AD. 

The seven catholic or universal Letters of James (1), Peter (2), John (3), 
and Jude (1) are so called because they are addressed to all the Churches, 
unlike the letters of Paul, which are addressed to a particular community 
(example: Romans). They were open letters that concerned themselves with 
different themes pertinent to Christians. The Letter of James emphasizes the 
necessity of faith and works and speaks of the power of the tongue. First Peter 
shows us the mission of the early Church in the midst of a hostile society, 
and provides direction for Christian behavior in the world. Second Peter 
notes that God bestows on us life and godliness, that living a virtuous 
life will ensure our calling and election to eternal life with Christ. 
First John expresses that God is love, his forgiveness in the face of sin,
 and asserts the humanity and Divinity of Jesus Christ. Second John warns 
 against heresy in the early Church, while Third John is a testimony to 
 the fidelity of early Christian communities. The Book of Jude gives 
 encouragement in fidelity to the Christian faith and notes the moral 
 implications of the Gospel message. The mysterious Book of Jude also 
 describes a phenomenon noted in some anesthetic patients with near-death 
 experiences: "They are like wild waves of the sea, foaming up their shameless
  deeds, wandering stars for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved 
  forever." 

The Book of Revelation is the final Book of the New Testament and is 
apocalyptic in nature. The Book of Revelation is at once frightening, 
as it speaks of the rise of the evil one, the Great Tribulation, and 
the end of the age; dramatic as it describes the final battle of good 
and evil; and, above all, optimistic, as it points to the triumph of 
Jesus Christ over evil and the dawn of a New Creation. Written by John, i
t has fascinated readers for centuries as it prophesizes about the End Times, 
a time which may be drawing near.

It was St. Augustine who best explained the relationship of the Old and New
 Testaments: 
"The new lies hidden in the old, the old is made manifest in the new."

The New Testament recorded the oral tradition of the Life and Teachings of 
Jesus Christ, his Passion, Death on the Cross, Resurrection and Ascension, 
and the formation of the early Christian community, the Church. 

Jesus of Nazareth and his Apostles spoke Aramaic, the common language at the
 time in the Levant. Syriac, a dialect of Aramaic, became the biblical and l
iturgical language of early Christian Churches in the East. Jesus the Messia
h addressed God in prayer, using the Aramaic word Abba, the affectionate ter
m for "Father" (Mark 14:36). Jesus raised the child by calling out Talitha c
umi, which means "little girl, arise" in Mark 5:41. He cured the man who was
 deaf and dumb by speaking Ephphatha, meaning "be opened" in Mark 7:34. Jesu
s refers to hell as Gehenna in Mark 9:42-50. Jesus used Aramaic words twice 
in referring to Peter: he used the prefix Bar-, "the son of," (not the Hebre
w Ben) when he called Peter Bar-Jonah, the son of Jonah (Matthew 16:17); and
 he called Peter Cephas, the Aramaic word for rock in John 1:42. Jesus cried

 out from the cross Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani, that is, "My God, my God, 
why have you forsaken me?" (Matthew 27:46, Mark 15:34). 

The canon of the New Testament is exactly the same for all of Christianity! 
There are 27 Books in our Greek New Testament: the Gospels of Matthew, Mark,
 Luke, and John, the Acts of the Apostles, the fourteen Letters of the Pauli

ne corpus, the seven catholic or universal Letters, and the Book of Revelati
on. 

No original manuscript by the author of a biblical book has ever been discov
ered! The oldest manuscripts available to us are the Curetonian and Sinaitic
us texts of the Old Syriac Gospels, the Greek Codex Sinaiticus from St. Cath
erine's Monastery on Mt. Sinai, Egypt, and the Codex Vaticanus in Greek from
 the fourth century AD.
