      <h2>Early Childhood Education Philosophy and Approach</h2>
      <p>As part of Jumpstart’s mission to ensure children enter kindergarten prepared to succeed, members work to provide high-quality services to children through Jumpstart classroom service and planning. Jumpstart provides members with the training, coaching, and support to ensure that all of Jumpstart’s activities provide children with high-quality, developmentally appropriate experiences and supportive interactions with well-trained adults. Jumpstart programming supports the success of all children by:  
        <ul>
          <li> Embracing a culturally competent approach to curriculum implementation that values diversity and children’s unique strengths, language backgrounds, and cultures.
          <li> Utilizing developmentally appropriate practice, including facilitating intentional powerful interaction and positive guidance strategies.
          <li> Engaging children in playful learning experiences with an emphasis on valuing children’s emotions, voices, and perspectives.
          <li> Holding all children to high expectations while striking a balance of adult-led and child-initiated learning.
          <li> Supporting children’s development of oral language and social-emotional skills in an inclusive environment where children feel safe, valued, respected, seen, and heard.
        </ul>
