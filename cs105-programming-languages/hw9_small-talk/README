COMP 105 - HW9 Smalltalk

Names: Yichen Wei
       Irina Mengqi Wang

How we tested the bignum code:
    We wrote unit test in natural-tests.smt to account for every single method 
    we wrote. We also run the given-natural-tests.smt provided by the course 
    staff. After passing both tests, we came up with more complex cases and
    wrote them in the exercise T.


The names of the people with whom we collaborated:
    We didn't discuss or collaborate with anyone else.

The numbers of the exercises we worked :
    We completed 37, 38, 39, T and ADT, and didn't attempt extra credits.

Acknowledgements: 
    We would like to thank course staff for providing the template for Natural 
    and methods for sdiv in SmallInteger. We also appreciate all the test 
    cases.
