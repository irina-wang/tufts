 1. Read
    section 6.3,
    which describes how Typed Impcore is extended with arrays.
    Examine code chunk 357, which shows
    the cases that have to be added to the type checker.

    For each case, name the type-system rule that applies.  Each
    answer should be a rule name like Apply or GlobalAssign.

      * The rule for case `| ty (AAT (a, i)) = ...` is:
            ArrayAt

      * The rule for case `| ty (APUT (a, i, e)) = ...` is:
            ArrayPut


      * The rule for case `| ty (AMAKE (len, init)) = ...` is:
            MakeArray

      * The rule for case `| ty (ASIZE a) = ...` is:
            ArraySize

    Now pick one of the rules and explain, in informal English, what
    the rule is supposed to do.

    _You are ready for exercise 18 in the pair problems._

 2. Read section 6.6.3 on quantified types in Typed μScheme.
    In addition to the prose, read the transcripts in the first couple
    pages of that section: each value that has a quantified type is
    instantiated later in the transcript, giving you more examples to
    relate back to the prose.

    (a) Assume variable `syms` holds a list of symbols (it has type
        `(list sym)`).  What expression do you write to compute its
        length? Pick exactly one of the options below.

        1. `(length syms)`
        2. `((o length sym) syms)`
       --> 3. `((@ length sym) syms)`
        4. `((length sym) syms)`


    (b) You are given a function `positive?` of type `(int -> bool)`.
        Using the predefined function `o`, which has type
        `(forall ('a 'b 'c) (('b -> 'c) ('a -> 'b) -> ('a -> 'c)))`,
        what code do you write to compose `positive?` with `not`?

        ([@ o int bool bool] not positive?)

    (c) In testing, we sometimes use a three-argument function `third`
        that ignores its first two arguments and returns its third
        argument.  Such a function has type

            (forall ('a 'b 'c) ('a 'b 'c -> 'c))

        There is only one sensible function that has this type.  Using
        a `val` definition, define function `third` in Typed μScheme. 
        You will need to use both `type-lambda` and `lambda`.

        (val third (type-lambda ['a 'b 'c]
                        (lambda ([x : 'a] [y : 'b] [z :'c])
                            z)))

    _You are ready for exercise TD._


 3. Read about type equivalence starting on page 378
    and page 380.

    You are given ML values `tau1` and `tau2`, which represent the
    respective Typed μScheme types `(forall ('a) 'a)` and `(forall ('b) 'b)`.
    Semantically, these types are equivalent. For each of the two ML
    expressions below, say whether the expression produces `true`
    or produces `false`. Write each answer immediately below the
    expression.

    (a) `tau1 = tau2`
        false

    (b) `eqType (tau1, tau2)`
        true

    _You will soon be ready for exercise 19, but
    you first need to complete the next two comprehension questions._


 4. Go back to section 6.6.5, which starts on page 370,
    and read the typing rules for expressions in Typed μScheme.
    For each of the expressions below, say if it is well typed, and if
    so, **what type it has**.  If the expression is not well typed, say
    what typing rule fails and why.

        ; (a)
        (if #t 1 #f)

            Not well typed. e2 should have the same type as e3. 

        ; (b)
        (let ([x 1]
              [y 2])
           (+ x y))
            
            Well typed. 
            int 


        ; (c)
        (lambda ([x : int]) x)
            Well typed.
            (int -> int)

        ; (d)
        (lambda ([x : 'a]) x)

             Not well typed. 'a is associated to polymorphism, should use an 
             initialied type.

        ; (e)
        (type-lambda ['a] (lambda ([x : 'a]) x))

            Well typed.
            (forall('a) ('a -> 'a))
  
    _You are almost ready for exercise 19._


 5. Read Lesson 5 ("Program design with typing
    rules") of [_Seven Lessons in Program
    Design_](../design/lessons.pdf).  In particular, read the
    explanation of how the [If]{.smallcaps} rule is rewritten to add
    type-equality judgments τ ≡ τ3 and τ1 ≡ bool.  Now look at the
    list of typing rules for expressions in Figure 6.12 on page 405
    in *Programming Languages: Build, Prove, and Compare*.
    Identify one other rule that needs to be rewritten in the same
    fashion as [If]{.smallcaps}, for the same reason.
    
    The rule you found is named → WHILE

    _You are now ready for exercise 19._


 6. Exercise R below calls for you to add a primitive reference type to
    Typed μScheme. Read it.  Then read "Primitive type constructors of
    Typed uScheme" in section 6.6.10, which starts on page 390.

    (a) When you add a primitive type constructor for references, what
        chunk of the source code do you intend to add it to?
        (Give the page number, and if applicable, the letter. For example,
        page 390 has chunks 390a and
        390b, and the letter is the simplest way to
        distinguish the two.)
        p390a 391e

    On page page 390,
    read "Selected primitive functions of typed uScheme."  And
    in section Q.5 of the 
    [Supplement](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/105/supplement.pdf), 
    which starts on page S399, 
    read "Primitives of Typed μScheme." 

    (b) Which set of primitive functions most resembles the functions
        you will need to add for references?
        The list primitives

    (c) When you add primitive functions that operate on references, what
        chunk of the source code do you intend to add them to?
        (Just like we asked above, give the page number, and if
        applicable, the letter.)
        391c 

    _You are ready for Exercise R._
