COMP 105 - HW6 ML

Name: Irina Mengqi Wang

Parts of the assignment completed:
    For Sunday, I completed cqs. 
    I did pair programming with Linh on the interpreter part of the HW.

Others with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment: 
    I went to Dogacan, Viet, Tim, and Janny's OH and 
        discussed the Homework with Emily, Linh and Yichen.

Any comments or feedback for course staff:
    I feel like it would be really helpful to have a live lecture just to check 
    in and go over what we learnt in during the sem. Watching lectures alone 
    really sucks :`(
