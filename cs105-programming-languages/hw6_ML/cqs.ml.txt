 1. Read section 5.1 of [Harper](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rwh/isml/book.pdf) 
    about tuple types and tuple patterns.  Also look at the list
    examples in sections 9.1 and 9.2 of Harper.

    Now consider the pattern `(x::y::zs, w)`. For each of the following
    expressions, tell whether the pattern matches the value denoted. If
    the pattern matches, say what values are bound to the four variables
    `x`, `y`, `zs`, and `w`. If it does not match, explain why not.

    (a) `([1, 2, 3], ("COMP", 105))`
    (b) `(("COMP", 105), [1, 2, 3])`
    (c) `([("COMP", 105)], (1, 2, 3))`
    (d) `(["COMP", "105"], true)`
    (e) `([true, false], 2.718281828)`

    Answers here:

    (a) Matches.
            x is an int 1
            y is an int 2
            zs is an int list [3]
            w is bound to a pair (string * int) ("COMP", 105)

    (b) Doesn't Match. The tuple(pair) ("COMP", 105) in the front does not match
        the list x::y::zs.

    (c) Doesn't Match. Because the list consist of only one element, which is 
        not able to construct through three elemens in x::y::zs.

    (d) Matches.
            x  is bound to string "COMP"
            y  is bound to string "105"
            zs is bound to string list []
            w  is bound to a bool true

    (e)  Matches.
            x  is bound to bool true
            y  is bound to bool false
            zs is bound to bool list []
            w  is bound to a real 2.718281828

    _You are starting to be ready to use pattern matching._


 2. Read the descriptions of patterns and example values (steps 3 and 2)
    in the fourth "[Lesson in Program Design](../design/lessons.pdf)."
    Look at Table 4.1, including the *Types of parts* column.  Using
    the ideas you find there, prepare to answer questions about this
    expression:
    
        case f (x, y, z) 
          of []      => raise Empty
           | w :: ws => if p w then SOME w else NONE

    You are told that the subexpression `f (x, y, z)` has type
    `'a list`.  Using that information, give the type of each of these
    code fragments, which are built from parts of patterns: 

    (a) The type of the pattern `w :: ws`

        → 'a list

    (b) The type of the variable `ws`

        → 'a list

    (c) The type of the expression `SOME w`

        → 'a option

    _You are ready to use pattern matching on common ML types._



 3. Read the section on unit testing in the [guide to learning
    ML](../readings/ml.pdf).  Read about infix function names in step 3 
    of the fourth [lesson on program design](../design/lessons.pdf).
    And read the section on [unit testing](#unit-testing) in this homework.

    Now, using the interpreter to be sure your answer is well typed,
    translate the following _failing_ unit test into ML:
    
        (check-expect  (foldl + 0 '(1 2 3)) 7)
    
    Your translation:

    → 
        val () = Unit.checkExpectWith Int.toString 
                                "foldl - sum is 7 (failing unit test)"
                (fn () => foldl (op +) 0 [1, 2, 3]) 
                7
        
    _You are ready to write unit tests._


 4. In chapter 5 of *Programming Languages: Build, Prove, and Compare*,
    study the definition of function `bindList` in chunk 312c.
    Now show a call to `bindList` that is well typed (passes type
    checking) but whose evaluation raises the `BindListLength` exception:
    
    > bindList ([1,2], [], emptyEnv)
    
    (Hint: keep things simple by passing `emptyEnv` as the third argument.)

    _You are ready to write `zip` and to write environment
    functions that use exceptions._


 5. "Free" variables are those that are not bound to a value in the
    current scope. You can find a longer discussion and precise
    definition in section 5.6 of *Build, Prove, and Compare*, 
    which starts on page 322. Read the section and identify the
    free variables of the expressions below.  *Remember that a name
    occurring in function position can be a free variable.*

     (a) Free variables of `(lambda (x) (lambda (y) (equal? x y)))`

         → equal?

     (b) Free variables of `(lambda (y) (equal? x y))`

         → x, equal? 

     (c) Free variables of

             (lambda (s1 s2)
               (if (or (atom? s1) (atom? s2))
                 (= s1 s2)
                 (and (equal? (car s1) (car s2))
                      (equal? (cdr s1) (cdr s2)))))

         → or, atom?, =, and, car, equal?, cdr

    _You are ready to improve the μScheme interpreter._ You may do
    this with a partner.  You and your partner will turn your answers
    to parts (a) and (b) into unit tests.
