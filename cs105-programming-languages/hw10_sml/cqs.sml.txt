 1. Using one of the sources in the [ML learning guide](../readings/ml.html),
    read about structures, signatures, and matching.  Then answer
    questions about the structure and signature below.

    The following structure contains definitions that should be
    familiar from the [ML homework](ml.html) and from code you may
    have seen in the course interpreters:

        structure ExposedEnv = struct
          type name   = string
          type 'a env = (name * 'a) list
          exception NotFound of name
          val emptyEnv = []

          fun lookup (name, [])              = raise NotFound name
            | lookup (name, (x, v) :: pairs) =
                if x = name then v else lookup (name, pairs)

          fun bindVar (name, value, env) = (name, value) :: env
        end

    Here is a signature:

        signature ENV = sig
          type name = string
          type 'a env
          val emptyEnv : 'a env
          val lookup   : name * 'a env -> 'a
          val bindVar  : name * 'a * 'a env -> 'a env
        end

    Answer these questions:

    (a) Does the structure match the signature?  That is, if we write

            structure Env :> ENV = ExposedEnv

        does the resulting code typecheck?  Please answer yes or no.

        Yes.

    (b) Does the signature expose enough information for us to write
        the following function?  Please answer yes or no.

            fun extendEnv (names, vals, rho) =
              ListPair.foldrEq Env.bindVar rho (names, vals)

        Yes.


    (c) Does the signature expose enough information for us to write
        the following function?  Please answer yes or no.

            fun isBound (name, rho) = (Env.lookup (name,rho) ; true) 
                                      handle Env.NotFound _ => false

        No.

    (d) If in part (b) or part (c), if it is not possible to write the
        function given, change the signature to make it possible.
        If necessary, please copy, paste, and edit your new version in
        here:


        signature ENV = sig
          type name = string
          type 'a env
          exception NotFound of name

          val emptyEnv : 'a env
          val lookup   : name * 'a env -> 'a
          val bindVar  : name * 'a * 'a env -> 'a env
        end



    (e) Suppose I change the `ENV` signature to make the `name` type
        abstract, so the code reads

            signature ENV' = sig
              type name
              type 'a env
              val emptyEnv : 'a env
              val lookup   : name * 'a env -> 'a
              val bindVar  : name * 'a * 'a env -> 'a env
            end
            structure Env' :> ENV' = ExposedEnv

        The new structure `Env'`, sealed with signature `ENV'`, is useless.
        Please explain *why* it is useless:

       It's useless because it did not specify what type name should be. 
       Therefore, client is unable to use name, lookup, or bindVar.


    *You now have the basic ideas needed to understand what is being
    asked of you in this assignment.*


 2. An ML _functor_ is a function that operates on the module level.
    Think of it as a "module in waiting" or a "module builder";
    a software engineer would call it a "generic module."
    A functor's _formal_ parameters, if any, are specified by a
    _sequence of declarations_, and its _actual_ parameters are given
    by a _sequence of definitions_.  A functor's _result_ is a
    structure.
    
    Read about functors in Harper, as recommended in the ML learning
    guide.  Then read about structure matching in section 24 of
    Tofte's "Tips for Computer Scientists on Standard ML."
    Then answer the questions below.
    
    (a) On page 183, Harper defines a functor `DictFun` which takes
        one parameter: a structure `K` matching signature `ORDERED`.
        A dictionary is implemented using a binary tree.  Suppose
        instead you want to implement a dictionary using a hash table.
        So you define a new functor `HashDictFun`, and it expects one
        parameter: a structure `K` with signature `HASHABLE`:

            functor HashDictFun(structure K : HASHABLE) :>
                      MUTABLE_DICT where type Key.t = K.t
              =
            struct
              ... imagine your beautiful hash table here ...
            end

        The new signature `HASHABLE` is analogous to Harper's
        signature `ORDERED`: it defines a key type `t`, plus every thing
        we need to know *about keys* to build a generic hash table with
        elements of type `t`.

        Fill in the complete definition of signature `HASHABLE` here:
        
            signature HASHABLE = sig
                type t
                val hash_fun : t -> int
                val equal_key : t * t -> bool
            end
            
    (b) For each component of your `HASHABLE` signature, whether it is
        a type component or a value component, say what you expect it
        to be used for in functor `HashDictFun`.
        _Write only English_, not code:

        > type t is a abstract data type, which can be assigned to any type 
        using where clause. 
        > hash_fun is a value component, which can convert a key into a ID 
        of int
        > equal_key is a value component which can compare two keys and return
        a boolean value of whether two keys are the same.


    (c) Suppose you have a structure `IntHash` that matches signature

            HASHABLE where type t = int
            
        Now suppose you apply function `DictFun`, from Harper's
        chapter, to structure `IntHash`.  This scenario is like the 
        examples on the bottom of page 184; I'm suggesting you try
        
            structure HIntDict = DictFun (structure K = IntHash).

        What will the ML compiler say?  Will it reject this
        application of DictFun or accept it?

          - If the compiler would reject the application, say one
            *specific* thing the compiler would complain about:
            
            > The functor does not match the signature. The "lt" fun in 
            signature does not exist in HASHABLE.
            
          - If the compiler would accept the application, explain why
            the compiler would be OK with it even though the functor expects
            module `K` with signature `ORDERED` and you are giving it
            module `K` with signature `HASHABLE`:


    *You now understand functors well enough to use them in exercises H and I.*

 3. Read about "signature refinement or specialization" in the
    [ML learning guide](../readings/ml.pdf).  Now,

    (a) In Harper's `DictFun` functor, explain what is going
        on with the `where type` syntax.

        In DictFun, it's specifying the type t in structure Key to be the
        same as the type t in structure ORDERED.

    (b) Explain what would go wrong if Harper wrote a definition
        _without_ `where type`:

            functor DictFun (structure K : ORDERED) :> DICT
              =
            struct
              ...
            end

        Then the two ts in structure Key and in structure ORDERED wouldn't be 
        treated as the same. And the t in Key would be still be abstract.

    *You now know enough to use functors in exercises H and I.*

 4. Read about abstraction functions and invariants in the lesson
    ["Program design with abstract data types"](../design/lessons.pdf).
    Then, from the ML homework, review the algebraic data type from
    the [natural-number problems](./ml.html#nat).

    Now answer these questions:
    
    (a) The lesson describes a sorted list as one possible
        representation for a set.  Define a function `invariant` that
        takes as argument a list of integers and returns a Boolean
        saying if the list is sorted in strictly ascending order
        (that is, increasing, with no repeats).  You may use ML or
        μScheme, and you may reuse any function assigned for homework
        this term:
        
        fun invariant []       = true                          
          | invariant [x::xs]  = case xs of [] => true         
                                        | [y::ys] => x < y andalso invariant xs
                
    (b) In the ML homework, the algebraic type `nat` satisfies two
        invariants.  In ML, define a function `invariant` of type
        `nat -> bool`, which returns true if and only if the given
        representation satisfies both invariants:
    
        fun invariant ZERO                = true
          | invariant (TIMES10PLUS(n, i)) = i < 10 andalso 
                                            not ((i = 0) andalso (n = ZERO)) 
                                            andalso invariant n

    *You are now ready to write abstraction functions and invariants
    in exercises I, N, and ADT.*

 5. Read about short division starting on page S21 of the book,
    and in ["Mastering Multiprecision Arithmetic"](../readings/arithmetic.pdf).

    (a) Divide 2918 by 7, calculating both quotient and remainder.  
        At each step, you divide a two-digit number by 7.  The
        remainder is passed along to form the next two-digit number.

              _________
            7 | 2 9 1 8

        At each step of the computation, you will take a two-digit
        dividend, divide by 7, and give quotient and remainder.
        The first step is

              02 divided by 7  ==  0 remainder 2
              29 divided by 7  ==  4 remainder 1
              11 divided by 7  ==  1 remainder 4
              48 divided by 7  ==  6 remainder 6

        There are four steps in total.  Edit the text above to state
        the dividend, divisor, quotient, and remainder at each step.
        Here, write the final four-digit quotient and the one-digit
        remainder:
           
           quotient:  0416
           remainder: 6

    *You are now ready to implement short division on natural numbers
    (for exercise N).*


 6. Going back to the same reading, and following the examples in the
    section "Using short division for base conversion," convert a
    number from decimal to binary and another number from decimal to octal.

    (a) Using repeated division by 2, convert decimal 13 to binary.
        The ["Mastering Multiprecision Arithmetic"](../readings/arithmetic.pdf)
        handout shows the form, so please just fill in the right-hand
        sides here: 

              q0 = 6          r0 = 1
              q1 = 3          r1 = 0
              q2 = 1          r2 = 1
              q3 = 0          r3 = 1

        Now write the converted numeral here: 1101

    (b) Using repeated division by 8, convert decimal 25 to octal 31.
        Follow the same model: at each step, give the intermediate
        quotient and remainder, and then form the final quotient by
        reading off the remainders.

            25 ÷ 8 = 3 remainder 1   q0 = 3    r0 = 1
            3 ÷ 8  = 0 remainder 3   q0 = 0    r0 = 3

         Now write the converted numeral here: octal 31

    *You are now ready to implement the `decimal` operation on natural
    numbers (for exercise N).  This will also enable you to implement
    the `toString` operation on signed integers.*
