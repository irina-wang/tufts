COMP 105 - HW2 opsem

Name: Irina Mengqi Wang

Parts of the assignment completed:
    I completed everything, but didn't have time to attempt the bonus!

Others with whom you have collaborated or discussed the assignment: 
    I went to Emun, Mico, Viet, Janny's OH. The recitation helped a lot as 
    well! I also discussed the Homework with Lihn and Yichen.


Any comments or feedback for course staff:
    The banana example really helped me understand how inductive hypothesis 
    work in metatheory proofs, but I think going through an example to emphasize
    on format and wordings would help even more!
