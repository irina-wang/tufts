In other words, it will also contain **high false negatives** which often come at a great cost---- patient may miss the \"golden window\" and even pay with their lives, not to the psychological suffering and late surgery fees. Hospital, on the other hand, may be sued for the diagnosis failure and experience a lost in reputation. These are pretty serious consequences, sometimes even worse than saying everyone has cancer with the always-1 classifier. Thus in general, I would not to use this classifier even though it might help avoid unnecessary biopsy operations."
